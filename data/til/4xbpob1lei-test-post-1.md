What's a **TIL**? **TIL** is short for "Today I Learned". It's a quick way to document things I learn while programming on the daily.

If you're interested in some of my earlier TILs, you can find them [here](https://til.hashrocket.com/authors/taylormock).

```elixir
def welcome() do
  IO.puts("Welcome!")
end
```
